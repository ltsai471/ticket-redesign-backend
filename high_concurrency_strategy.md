1. **Database Level Optimizations**:
   - Use database transactions with proper isolation levels (REPEATABLE_READ or SERIALIZABLE)
   - Implement optimistic locking using version numbers
   - Add appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Consider using database connection pooling

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement Redis for caching:
     - Cache seat availability status
     - Cache campaign information
     - Cache user session data
   - Use distributed caching to share state across multiple application instances

3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Deploy multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer
   - Use sticky sessions if needed for user-specific data
   - Consider using a CDN for static content

4. **Queue System**:
   - Implement a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for ticket purchase requests
   - Process ticket purchases asynchronously
   - Implement a queue consumer to handle the actual database updates
   - Use dead letter queues for failed transactions

5. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting per user/IP
   - Use token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm
   - Consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting

6. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
   - Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
   - Fallback mechanisms for service failures
   - Graceful degradation of features

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Real-time monitoring of system metrics
   - Alert system for critical issues
   - Log aggregation for debugging

8. **Database Scaling**:
   - Consider read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Implement database sharding if needed
   - Use database partitioning for large tables

9. **API Design**:
   - Implement idempotency for ticket purchase requests
   - Use proper HTTP status codes and response formats
   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

10. **Security Measures**:
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization
    - Use HTTPS for all communications
    - Implement request validation and sanitization
    - Protect against common attacks (CSRF, XSS, etc.)

11. **Testing Strategy**:
    - Load testing to identify bottlenecks
    - Stress testing to determine system limits
    - Chaos testing to ensure system resilience
    - Performance testing for critical paths

12. **Deployment Strategy**:
    - Use containerization (Docker)
    - Implement CI/CD pipelines
    - Use infrastructure as code
    - Implement blue-green deployment

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide more specific implementation details for any particular component?
